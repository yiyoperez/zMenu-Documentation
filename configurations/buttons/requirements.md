# 🏁 Requirements

## Requirements

### Syntax

```yaml
# open_requirement
# click_requirement
view_requirement:

  # Set the minimum number of requirements to be able to say this is a success.
  # By default the value will be the same as the number of requirements.
  minimumRequirement: <number>
  
  # List of requirements, all information about each type below
  requirements:
    - type: permission
      permission: "example.permission"
      deny:
        - type: message
          messages:
            - "&cYou don't have permission !"
    - type: placeholder
      placeholder: "%player_gamemode%" # need PAPI ecloud Player
      value: "CREATIVE"    
      action: equals_string
      # Specific deny actions
      deny:
        - type: message
          messages:
            - "&cYou mus be in creative"      
    - type: regex
      input: "%player_item_in_hand%" # need PAPI ecloud Player
      regex: "(NETHERITE_|DIAMOND_|IRON_|GOLDEN_|STONE_|WOODEN_|LEATHER_|BOW|CROSSBOW|FISHING_ROD|SHEARS|SHIELD|TRIDENT|TURTLE_HELMET|ELYTRA|FLINT_AND_STEEL)"      
      deny:
        - type: message
          messages:
            - "&cYou dont have items in your hand !"
  
  # Global Success actions
  success:
    - type: sound
      sound: ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP
      
  # Global Deny actions
  deny:    
    - type: message
      messages:
        - "&cYou doesn't have an item in your hand."
```

In addition to global deny and success actions, you can define specific deny and success actions for each requirement.

### View Requirement

Defines the requirements a player must meet to see a button in the inventory.

#### Example:

```yaml
view_requirement:
  deny:
    - type: chat
      messages:
        - "Hey, my name is %player%"
  success:
    - type: sound
      sound: ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP
  requirements:
    - type: permission
      permission: "admin.use"
    - type: placeholder
      placeholder: "%player_is_flying%"
      value: "yes"
      action: equals_string
```

### Open Requirement

Defines the requirements a player must meet to open the inventory.

#### Example

```yaml
open_requirement:
  requirements:
    - type: regex
      input: "%player_item_in_hand%"
      regex: "(NETHERITE_|DIAMOND_|IRON_|GOLDEN_|STONE_|WOODEN_|LEATHER_|BOW|CROSSBOW|FISHING_ROD|SHEARS|SHIELD|TRIDENT|TURTLE_HELMET|ELYTRA|FLINT_AND_STEEL)"
  deny:
    - type: message
      messages:
        - "&cYou doesn't have an item in your hand."
```

In the example below, there is a check for the item in the player's hand. If the item matches the regex pattern, the player can open the inventory. Otherwise, they will receive a message, and the inventory will not open.

### Click Requirement

Defines multiple requirements for clicking the button. You need to specify several requirements and the corresponding clicks.

You can apply all clicks directly by using the following format:

```yaml
clicks:
  - ALL # or ANY
```

You can set the click type to `ALL` or `ANY` to apply the actions to all clicks. The list of clicks that will be included can be managed in the `config.json` file.

#### Example:

```yaml
click_requirement:
  left_click: # You must put a name for your requirement, it will not be used.
    clicks:
      - LEFT
      - SHIFT_LEFT
    requirements:
      - type: placeholder
        placeholder: "%player_gamemode%"
        value: "CREATIVE"
        action: equals_string
    deny:
      - type: sound
        sound: VILLAGER_NO
        pitch: 0.5f
        volume: 1.5f
    success:
      - type: message
        messages:
          - "&aLeft click !"
  right_click: # You must put a name for your requirement, it will not be used.
    clicks:
      - RIGHT
      - SHIFT_RIGHT
    requirements:
      - type: placeholder
        placeholder: "%player_gamemode%"
        value: "CREATIVE"
        action: equals_string
    deny:
      - type: sound
        sound: VILLAGER_NO
        pitch: 1.5f
        volume: 0.5f
    success:
      - type: message
        messages:
          - "&aRight click !"
```
